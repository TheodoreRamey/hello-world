# hello-world

Hi!

I'm Teddy Ramey, currently a Computer Science student at Boise State University. 
I work at a restaurant currently, but I'm hoping to get an internship doing work with software this coming summer(2021).
I enjoy working with C and java, and I know some assembly as well. I'm starting to get comfortable on linux too.
In my personal life I enjoy longboarding, beer, the outdoors, and some good ol' video games.
